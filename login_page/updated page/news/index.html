                        <p>
                            All eyes are, of course, on Bumrah. The India spearhead, who has been sidelined since the first innings of the Sydney Test during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy earlier in January, has been undergoing rehabilitation in Bengaluru. Sources say that outgoing BCCI Sports Science chief Nitin Patel is personally monitoring the pacer, who is dealing with stress on his back, an ailment for which he underwent surgery in early 2023. It is likely that Bumrah will be cleared by the end of the month, although it remains uncertain when exactly he will be able to don the Mumbai Indians colors.
